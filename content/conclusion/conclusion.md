We are continuosly improving our syllabus. If you find yourself looking for information [ACN syllabus](http://syllabus.africacode.net/topics/) is a good place to start. Just press `ctrl` + `f` and search for what you need(chances are, there's a topic about it). Alternatively, ask a human within the organization for clarity.
