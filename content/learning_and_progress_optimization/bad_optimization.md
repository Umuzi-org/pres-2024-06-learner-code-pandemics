## Bad optimization

- **Multitasking:** This will distract & slow you down.
- **Quick incomplete reviews:** Remember that the aim is to spread learning and value.
- **Dismissing the foundational concepts:** You can only work with the shiny things if you understand the fundamentals.
- **Optimizing for getting cards to complete:** Seek understanding, the cards will close themselves.
- **Copying and using AI:** Sigh! You know you're shooting yourself on the foot.
