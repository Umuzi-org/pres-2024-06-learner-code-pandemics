## Good testing

- **Write the tests First**: Start with a test that defines the desired functionality before writing the corresponding code.

- **Keep Tests Simple and Focused**: Ensure each test covers a single aspect of the functionality this keeps tests clear and maintainable.

- **Mocking and spying correctly**: Follow project instructions - they will often signal when mocks and speies are required. Sometimes we leave it to the learner to make the call - make the right call and base it on understanding.
