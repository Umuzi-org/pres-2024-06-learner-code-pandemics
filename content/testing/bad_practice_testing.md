## Bad testing

- **Writing Tests After Code**: This defeats the purpose of TDD, which emphasizes writing tests first to guide development.

- **Writing Large Tests**: Learners often write tests that cover too much functionality at once, making it difficult to identify specific issues.

- **Over-Mocking**: Excessive use of mocks can lead to tests that don't adequately reflect real-world scenarios.
