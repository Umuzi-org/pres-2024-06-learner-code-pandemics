## What to do about cargo culting

Both assignees and reviewers are guilty of cult-ish behaviors. If you are reviewing code and there are things in the code that seem culty, please address this with the assignee in the form of a review. If you are an assignee and you receive a culty review, please address this with the reviewer. If it persists, inform your LX coach who will loop in a SME to investigate further.
