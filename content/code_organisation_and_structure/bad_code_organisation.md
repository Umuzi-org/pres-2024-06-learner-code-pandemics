## Bad code organization

Characteristics:

- Ignoring **Single responsibilty principle**: Functions do too much.
- **Inconsistent Naming**: Hard to follow.
- No **Cohesion**: Things are scattered all over
- **Hardcoded Values**: Inflexible code.
- **Poor Error Handling**: No proper error management.
- No **Loose coupling**: Changes in one function effects the performance of another function.

Badly Organized Code is hard to read, maintain, and error-prone.
