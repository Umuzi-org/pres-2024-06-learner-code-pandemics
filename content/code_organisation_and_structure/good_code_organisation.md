- Adhering to **Single Responsibility Principle**: Small, focused functions.
- **Cohersive**: Things that belong together are kept together.
- **Loose coupling**: Function don't know the implementation of another function.
- **Consistent Naming**: Descriptive and uniform names.
- **DRY Principle**: No repeated code.
- **Proper Error Handling**: Errors handled effectively or left.

Well Organized Code is clear, modular, maintainable, and robust.
