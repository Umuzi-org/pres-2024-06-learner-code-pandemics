**What do do about cargo culting**

Both assignees and reviewers are guilty of cultish behaviors. If you are reviewing code and there are things in the code that seem culty, please address this with the assignee in the form of a review. If you are an assignee and you recieve a culty review, please address this with your LX coach who will loop in a SME to investigate further.
